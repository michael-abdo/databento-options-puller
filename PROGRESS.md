# Databento Options Project - Progress Summary

## ✅ Completed Steps (4/10)

### Step 1: Setup Foundation
- Created complete project structure
- Implemented logging configuration with multi-file support
- Created date utilities for trading calendar
- Created symbol parsing utilities
- Set up configuration management

### Step 2: Build Example Analyzer  
- Successfully extracts all facts from example_output.csv
- Identifies 5 option symbols with correct parsing
- Finds active periods for each option
- Discovers roll schedule (4 roll events)
- Extracts price patterns and timing patterns

### Step 3: Create Stub Generator
- Generates output matching example structure
- Creates correct option columns
- Uses facts to determine active periods
- Implements stub pricing with trends

### Step 4: Implement Validator
- Comprehensive validation against example
- Identifies all discrepancies:
  - Date format (12/2/21 vs 12/02/21)
  - Extra Futures_Price column
  - Row count mismatch (66 vs 81)
  - Value differences
- Current match: 28.18%

## 🔍 Key Findings

### From Example Analysis:
- No Futures_Price column in example
- Options roll monthly around the 1st
- Each option active for ~29 trading days
- Clear progression: F2→G2→H2→J2→K2 (Jan→May 2022)

### From Validation:
- Date formatting needs adjustment
- Need to match exact row count
- Must remove Futures_Price column
- Active periods need refinement

## 📊 Current Status

The feedback loop foundation is complete:
- ✅ Analyze → Generate → Validate cycle works
- ✅ Detailed logging captures all decisions
- ✅ Clear identification of what needs fixing

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Steps 5-6):
- Build parameter refiner to fix identified issues
- Wire everything together in main loop
- Iterate until 100% match

### Future (Steps 7-10):
- Add unit tests
- Integrate real Databento API
- Implement delta calculations
- Prepare for production

## 💡 Architecture Success

The modular design is working well:
- Each component has single responsibility
- Easy to debug with detailed logs
- Clear path to improve match score

The closed feedback loop approach is proving effective - we know exactly what's wrong and can systematically fix it.
