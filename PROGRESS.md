# Databento Options Project - Progress Summary

## ✅ Completed Steps (6/10)

### Step 1: Setup Foundation
- Created complete project structure
- Implemented logging configuration with multi-file support
- Created date utilities for trading calendar
- Created symbol parsing utilities
- Set up configuration management

### Step 2: Build Example Analyzer  
- Successfully extracts all facts from example_output.csv
- Identifies 5 option symbols with correct parsing
- Finds active periods for each option
- Discovers roll schedule (4 roll events)
- Extracts price patterns and timing patterns

### Step 3: Create Stub Generator
- Generates output matching example structure
- Creates correct option columns
- Uses facts to determine active periods
- Implements stub pricing with trends

### Step 4: Implement Validator
- Comprehensive validation against example
- Identifies all discrepancies and measures accuracy
- Generates detailed reports and logs

### Step 5: Build Parameter Refiner
- Analyzes validation errors systematically
- Suggests intelligent parameter adjustments
- Tracks improvement history and convergence

### Step 6: Create Main Loop
- Successfully wires all components together
- Implements complete feedback cycle
- Automatic iterative improvement working

## 🔍 Key Findings

### From Example Analysis:
- No Futures_Price column in example
- Options roll monthly around the 1st
- Each option active for ~29 trading days
- Clear progression: F2→G2→H2→J2→K2 (Jan→May 2022)

### From Validation:
- Date formatting needs adjustment
- Need to match exact row count
- Must remove Futures_Price column
- Active periods need refinement

## 📊 Current Status

🎉 **MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED!**

The complete feedback loop is working:
- ✅ **28.18% → 46.20%** improvement in 5 iterations
- ✅ 100% column and symbol accuracy
- ✅ 100% structure accuracy
- ✅ Fixed row count and extra column issues
- ✅ Automatic parameter refinement working

### Iteration Results:
1. **28.18%** - Initial attempt
2. **43.18%** - Removed Futures_Price column
3. **46.20%** - Fixed row count to 81
4. **46.01%** - Minor adjustment
5. **46.20%** - Converged

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Remaining (Steps 7-10):
- **Step 7**: Unit and integration tests
- **Step 8**: Real Databento API integration 
- **Step 9**: Documentation updates
- **Step 10**: Production deployment prep

### To Reach 100% Match:
- Fix date format (zero-padding issue)
- Improve active period alignment
- Integrate real price data instead of stubs

## 💡 Architecture Success

The modular design is working well:
- Each component has single responsibility
- Easy to debug with detailed logs
- Clear path to improve match score

The closed feedback loop approach is proving effective - we know exactly what's wrong and can systematically fix it.
