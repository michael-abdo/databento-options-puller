# Instructions to Push to GitHub

## 1. Create a New GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `databento-options-puller`
3. Description: "Automated NY Harbor ULSD options data extraction with 15-delta targeting and monthly rolling strategy"
4. Make it **Public** or **Private** as you prefer
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Push the Code

After creating the empty repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/databento-options-puller.git

# Verify the remote was added
git remote -v

# Push the code
git push -u origin main
```

If you use SSH instead of HTTPS:
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/databento-options-puller.git
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. If You Get Authentication Errors

For HTTPS, you'll need a Personal Access Token:
1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Generate new token (classic)
3. Give it `repo` permissions
4. Use the token as your password when prompted

## 4. Verify Success

After pushing, your repository should show:
- All the code files
- Professional README.md
- Complete documentation in `docs/`
- Examples in `examples/`
- Test suite in `tests/`

## 5. Optional: Add Repository Topics

In your GitHub repo, click the gear icon next to "About" and add topics:
- `python`
- `options-trading`
- `databento`
- `quantitative-finance`
- `black-scholes`
- `commodities`
- `data-extraction`

## 6. Optional: Create a Release

1. Go to "Releases" → "Create a new release"
2. Tag version: `v1.0.0`
3. Release title: "Initial Release - Databento Options Puller"
4. Description: "Complete implementation with mock data support and comprehensive documentation"

## Current Git Status

Your local repository is ready with:
- 2 commits with all the code
